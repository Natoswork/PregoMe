            ABOUT
          </h3>
          PregoMe is a mobile application in development, which enables pregnant women to instantly chat with an expert virtually in any field connected to pregnancy and birth giving.

          The knowledge about pregnancy and maternity is often very romanticised, but the actual pregnancy related questions are in fact often intimidating for women. A mobile application giving access to timely advice from experts like midwives has life changing impact. It helps to solve a lot of day-to-day problems and insecurities for pregnant women.

          Competitive analysis and market study proved that there is no such an application on the market at all. Lack of helpful, quick, and easily accessible direct connection & support from midwives and other moms is the status quo to improve. Needs of this important target of every society, needs to be taken seriously.

          Here comes the solution: PregoMe, carried by moms, supported by midwives.
          A new mobile application designed to serve future moms and moms!

            1. Interviews, Personas, User Journeys
          </h3>
          <p>
            The main approach of PregoMe was and is to serve moms to be. To make pregnancy of many women easier by having a digital product at hand which follows needs and insecurities and acts in a caring, intuitive and simple way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I conducted interviews after having the idea clearly set to find out if my plannings and presumptions were according to users needs and what could I do/plan/consider for the better outcome. Collected input helped me creating personas and user journey maps in the next stage.

            2. User Flows & Sitemap
          </h3>
          <p>
            PregoMe is including few but all basic features following needs and goals of my personas. Every user flow is straight forward, simple and clean. Whatever the user story might be, the user flow will be intuitive.

            PregoMe features are:<br/><br/>

            1. Find a suitable midwife for you in your neighborhood.<br/>
            2. Check all the important information and her availability instantly.<br/>
            3. Request midwife service easily and communicate directly.<br/>
            4. Get in touch with moms and experts around you 24/7.<br/>
            5. The Community room is the home and platform for exchange and open communication.<br/><br/>

            The actual sitemap shows all features and flows. The simplicity I’m showing below should be represented equally in the app itself.

            Wireframing started with pencil and paper. After verifying consistency between sitemap and wireframes I developed a first digital prototype.

          </h3>
          <p>
I tested my digital prototypes on some pregnant women and on some moms, with the main goal to test and measure the accessibility for users interacting with the PregoMe app for the first time on mobile. Testing included to use the app and to answer some additional questions. I gained some insights about the challenges of the app, its design and  the steps required for improvement.
