            ABOUT
          </h3>
          PregoMe is a mobile application in development, which enables pregnant women to instantly chat with an expert virtually in any field connected to pregnancy and birth giving.

          The knowledge about pregnancy and maternity is often very romanticised, but the actual pregnancy related questions are in fact often intimidating for women. A mobile application giving access to timely advice from experts like midwives has life changing impact. It helps to solve a lot of day-to-day problems and insecurities for pregnant women.

          Competitive analysis and market study proved that there is no such an application on the market at all. Lack of helpful, quick, and easily accessible direct connection & support from midwives and other moms is the status quo to improve. Needs of this important target of every society, needs to be taken seriously.

          Here comes the solution: PregoMe, carried by moms, supported by midwives.
          A new mobile application designed to serve future moms and moms!

          <p>
            The main approach of PregoMe was and is to serve moms to be. To make pregnancy of many women easier by having a digital product at hand which follows needs and insecurities and acts in a caring, intuitive and simple way.

            I conducted interviews after having the idea clearly set to find out if my plannings and presumptions were according to users needs and what could I do/plan/consider for the better outcome. Collected input helped me creating personas and user journey maps in the next stage.
